# Python Reverse Shell

This is a pure reverse shell, no custom commands, nothing but pure os commands.
Just a `client.py` ( that the victim need to execute ),
and the `server.py` that the attacker need to open, it just sends the commands to the client and receive the output.
( `server.py` NEEDS TO BE RAN AS ADMIN )
